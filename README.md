#wait-for-remote-support#

### Summary ###

Start Reverse SSH Tunnel for remote support after retrieving connection information from Neighborhoodguard support web.

Problem: You (the Supporter) are behind a firewall and have linux computers behind other firewalls that you need SSH access to (the Supportee)<br>
Solution: Have the Supportee connect with a reverse SSH tunnel to an SSH server on the internet  (Bouncing-server) and then you can connect to the same Bouncing-server and issue a command to get an ssh connection to the Suportee

Problem: You (the Supporter) does not want to have hardcoded Bouncing-server hostname, port etc lying on the Supportees, it is also a support nightmare<br>
Solution: Create a script to retrieve the information from a designated server.

###Easy Installation###

In Piguard Menu select "Support Menu" then "Install Remote Support"

###Manual Installation###

Download wait-for-remote-support.sh to ~/[your dir]

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JesperJurcenoks/wait-for-remote-support/master/wait-for-remote.support.sh -O ~/[your dir]/wait-for-remote-support.sh

Give wait-for-remote-support.sh execute rights 

sudo chmod +x ~/[your dir]/wait-for-remote-support.sh

To run on the host that needs remote support

~/[your dir]/wait-for-remote-support.sh

###Setup Connection without password prompt###
```
  HOSTNAME="`cat /etc/hostname`"
  URL="http://[your server here]/remote-support/"$HOSTNAME"-remote-support"
  wget $URL -O ~/[your dir]/remote-support
  if [ $? = 0 ]; then
    USERNAME=$(grep "^username.*=" ~/[your dir]/remote-support | sed "s/username.*=//1" | sed "s/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]//1")
    HOSTNAME=$(grep "^host.*=" ~/[your dir]/remote-support | sed "s/host.*=//1" | sed "s/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]//1")

    if [ -d "/home/pi/.ssh" ]; then
      echo "directory /home/pi/.ssh already exists"
    else
      mkdir ~/.ssh
      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
    fi
    if [ -e "/home/pi/.ssh/id_rsa" ]; then
      echo "RSA Key already exists - leave be"
    else
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""
    fi
    echo "clear out the old bounce-server key"
    ssh-keygen -R $HOSTNAME
    echo "get the current bounce-server key"
    ssh-keyscan -H $HOSTNAME >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    echo "copy our key to bounce-server - Password required"
    ssh-copy-id $USERNAME@$HOSTNAME
  else
    echo "failed to get needed file"
    echo "try again"
    echo
    echo "press any key to continue"
    read -s -n 1
  fi
```


###Configuration of connection information###

Adapt the hardcoded server path to your own server name and path

place a file with connection information for each host where you are offering remote support, make sure each host has a unique name.

==========file contents============
username=[username on the bouncing ssh host]
host=[dnsname/IP address of the ssh host where you are bouncing the ssh connection through]
port=[unique port for each host]
remoteusername=[name used to login on the host that needs support]
===========end of file=============

Note: The script supports both Unix AND Windows style newlines in this file
